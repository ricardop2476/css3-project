  <h2>Timeline</h2>

  <h3>Late 1950’s Skateboarding is Born</h3>

  <p>The first stage of the skateboard is made. People attach roller skate wheels to a small boards of wood. The main influence of skateboarding came from surf culture and surfers in general, therefore the first people that practiced skateboarding were surfers.
    Surfers attempted to recreate the experience of surfing when they could not do it, by skateboarding. Skateboarding in other words had become a way to surf on land; it had become known as “sidewalk surfing”. </p>

  <h3>The 1970’s Boom</h3>
  <p>The skateboarding industry experienced a massive influx of new manufactures and products. New product flew into the market. For example, Boulder Boards out of Colorado manufactured skateboard decks, however they were a furniture manufacture initially.
    This was a quick attempt to profit from the skateboarding industry because skateboarding had become popular. ACS Trucks were developed from American Cycle Systems, which made bicycle parts. Many of these corporations attempted to redefine the already
    common anatomy of the skateboard. The Rad Pad developed a riser pad at an angle to make the truck turn differently. The Yo Yo Rollerball skateboarding wheel changed the dimensions of the wheel to make it more circular. The heading of the advertisement
    can read “these radical new designs will revolutionize your skateboarding”. They designed their advertisements to captivate skateboarders to show how their revisions provided more convenience and fun for the general experience of skateboarding. This
    trend eventually died off because these new products were not as functional as the equipment prior to this era. Also during the middle to late 70’s the development of skateparks across the nation was beginning to increase rapidly. During 1978 and
    1979 the Hester Series began to take place. These were some of the first bowl riding contests. The Hester Series turned into the Gold Cup Series and then into the NSA Series throughout the 80’s. </p>

  <h3>1980’s Death and Rebirth</h3>
  <p>In 1980 and 1981 skateboarding went through a dark period because the industry crashed. Skateparks began to close throughout the nation because of low attendance and high insurance rates. A Lot of problems with liability issues arose as well. As if
    things could not get any worse the infamous Skateboarder Magazine went out of business - there was no longer a skateboard magazine present therefore all means of expressing skateboarding and its actions were eliminated. (There was no YouTube or social
    media at this time so skateboarders could not see what was going on!) Also, one of the founders of NHS, Jay Sherman passed away in 1980. Due to the lack of a skateboard magazine present, the remaining founders of NHS choose to establish Thrasher Magazine
    together. This was also a benefit to NHS because they could find a way to advertise Independent Trucks. This dark era in skateboarding did not last for long because of the development of Thrasher Magazine. Once the magazine began to make several issues,
    skateboarding gradually began to take its place again. It took about 5 years for the industry to being rolling again. (1985)
  </p>

  <h3>1990’s Street Era</h3>
  <p>During 1989 and the early 90’s skateboarders began to skate in urban environments. Also during the early 90’s skateboarding experienced a significant action by Vans: They were beginning to produce shoes with skateboarders names on them, and also let
    them design the shoe. They were basically signature shoes. This practice is done to this day with many other shoe companies within the skateboarding industry. As the type of skateboarding that skateboarders was changing, so did the shoes. Many shoes,
    decks, and other key components of skateboard parts were changed slightly to fit the needs of street skating. One example would be smaller deck shapes, low top/mid top shoes, smaller wheels, and more. As a result the street skateboarding era, the
    skateboarding shoe was re modified throughout 1992-1996. By 1995 skateboarding was beginning to get recognized by society, and it appears in ESPN and in commercial. Fashion trends during this era were influenced by skateboarders and even today they
    are.
  </p>

  <h3>2000’s and Present Day</h3>
  <p>Skateboarding is now beginning to go back to its roots. During the early 2000’s many skateboarders were beginning to return back to using old school shoes and other products from the past. Many cities have built high quality skateparks and skateboarding
    was entered every social circle. Skateboarding continues to progress, and new companies emerge and continue to provide a variety of products for skateboarders. Many people have access to skateboarding as it is more common and more accessible. There
    is a variety of skateboarders now: some skate pools and bowls, others skate street, etc.
