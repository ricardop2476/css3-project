    <h3>Art</h3>
    <p>Art and Skateboarding belong together without a doubt. Does art influence skateboarding, or does skateboarding influence art? One major person that strongly represented the connection between these two would be Craig Stecyk. In SkateBoarder Magazine Vol. 2, No. 2 his Dogtown article approached a more artistic way in representing skateboarding. Jeremy Henderson claims that “Art and skateboarding go together. They are both created, they are both from the same place in the mind and the consciousness, and they’re both reacting to the space of architecture.” Some of the first people to begin drawing their own skateboard graphics were Neil Blender, and John Lucero. Skateboard graphics represented who the skateboarder was and contributed even more to the growing relationship between art and skateboarding. The development of skateboarding <a href="http://skatezines.com/">zines</a> also added to this connection. A skate zine is a small booklet containing photographs, illustrations, articles, and event dates related to skateboarding. Thrasher Magazine even includes a two page section in every issue called “Canvas” that shows a skateboarder/artist and some of their work. <a href="http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/thrasher-canvas-three-decades-of-skate-art/">Thrasher Magzine's Canvas</a>
