    <h3>Art</h3>
    <p>Art and Skateboarding belong together without a doubt. Does art influence skateboarding, or does skateboarding influence art? One major person that strongly represented the connection between these two would be Craig Stecyk. In SkateBoarder Magazine Vol. 2, No. 2 his Dogtown article approached a more artistic way in representing skateboarding.

        “Art and skateboarding go together. They are both created, they are both from the same place in the mind and the consciousness, and they’re both reacting to the space of architecture.” Jeremy Henderson

      Some of the first people to begin drawing their own skateboard graphics were Neil Blender, and John Lucero. Skateboard graphics represented who the skateboarder was and contributed even more to the growing relationship between art and skateboarding. The development of skateboarding <a href="http://skatezines.com/">zines</a> also added to this connection. A skate zine is a small booklet containing photographs, illustrations, articles, and event dates related to skateboarding. Thrasher Magazine even includes a two page section in every issue called “Canvas” that shows a skateboarder/artist and some of their work. <a href="http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/thrasher-canvas-three-decades-of-skate-art/">Thrasher Magazine's Canvas</a>

    <h3>Photography</h3>
    <p>Skateboarding photos are very important to skate culture and history. Each photo tells a different story that captivates the era of skateboarding. They were very influential because during the origins and growth of skateboarding it was a way to progress skateboarding and to see what was going on in the skate scene.

    <p id = "quote">“My favorite skate photos; I usually go back to older photos because it was a time when photographs were all you knew about skating” Lance Dawes.</p>
    <p>
    Today we have social media and the internet which could be one of the reasons why skateboarding is breaking new boundaries and records every day. Skateboarders have instant access to see what is going on. Skateboarding photos were also significant because they also captured what was occurring off the skateboard. It captured the culture and lifestyle of skateboarders.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Videos</h3>
    <p>As skateboarding continued to progress, so did technology and therefore the ways of capturing skateboarding transitioned more heavily upon videos. The photography of skateboarding was still present and was not affected by skateboarding films. A photo has the same significance as a video. Today, skate videos are a way to show all of the contributions that a “skate team” as developed and also to show a skater's best performance. Some videos can be full lengths that show multiple skaters performance under one company. For example, a skateboarding wheel company may sponsor several skateboarders and may release a full video consisting of “video parts” from what those skaters have provided. Another video might film a skateboarding event or contest. Some skate videos could capture a trip that skateboarders went on and could capture their experiences. As long it’s plot revolves around skateboarding, there is no rules to making a film.

    Filming is a way to show the limit of one's skateboarding and the dedication they have for it: “Actually doing skateboarding and it being so f--king difficult to do it made sense why it went video because it's just like you can try something forever and then show it.” Anthony Van Engelen.
