  <p>I hope that everyone enjoys this website, even if you are a skateboarder or not. It amazes me to see how much this wooden toy has transformed me in the past four years. It has shaped my personality, approaches to problems in my life, and my attitude towards life in general. In order to get good at anything in life you have to learn from your mistakes, and this applies 100% to skateboarding. Skateboarding keeps me ‘active’ and has helped me explore the wonderful city that I reside in. It has helped me make new friends and even made me lose some. The reason why I skate is because it sets me apart from everyone else in my community and at school. 
    <br> Many companies that once had a dense skateboarder customer population, are now diminished to absolutely nothing. It hurts me to see that this group of people that ridicule skateboarders are buying skate-related product to look a certain way because celebrities and other kids are doing it. Be yourself! Hopefully many people think about what that popular logo means before they purchase it and try and fit in with everyone else.
    <br> <i>"It's just a plank of wood with wheels on it".</i> Yeah.
