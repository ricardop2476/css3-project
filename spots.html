    <h3>DIY Skateparks</h3>
    <p>“Do It Yourself Skateparks” are skateparks built and designed by skateboarders. Many are not content with the skateparks that they are provided with, therefore they attempt to develop their own. Many of these skateparks are not legal and can result in tensions between skateboarders and the local authority. Some projects might be significantly small, and others might be very large. To see live examples of DIY projects in modern day skateboarding visit <a href="http://skateboarding.transworld.net/tag/diy/">transworld skateboarding</a> .

    <h3>Pools/Bowls</h3>
    <p>One of the first terrains that skateboarders have conquered would be the backyard pool. Backyard pools were obviously not made for skateboarding however skateboarders have adapted to recognize and appreciate pool skateboarding. Whether an individual is a street skater, vert skater, or anything else, pool skating is well known with in skateboarding and can even take credit for developing street skateboarding. The reasoning behind this statement would be because early street skateboarding such as curb skating were mimicking vertical. People skated curbs, and ledges, then hand rails, then stairs, etc.
    
    Bowls are an extension of the backyard pool. Backyard pools do not possess a lot of transition, and contain more vert within their build. Therefore bowls are made for skateboarding. Most bowls can be found in skateparks around the world. Bowls have similar traits to those of pools such as: the coping, tiles, shape, and more.

    <h3>Vert Ramps</h3>
    <p>Backyard ramps/vert ramps were a response to the 70’s death of skateboarding. As skateparks closed down people that were still passionate about skateboarding built backyard vert ramps. These ramps became popular in the east and west coast, however the vert ramp scene was present in the midwest as well. The development of the vert ramp was also an attempt to bring back skateboarding.

    <h3>Street Skateboarding</h3>
    <p>Street Skateboarding has began during the early 90’s and ever since the progression of street skateboarding has not stopped. Skateboarders seek out urban obstacles such as handrails, stairs, ledges, curbs, parking blocks, etc. The majority of skateboarders today are street skateboarders because it is more accessible.</p>
    
    <h3>Skateparks</h3>
    <p>As skateboarding became more popular throughout the years, the development of skateparks have not only provided profit for the creators, but also provided a place for skateboarders to have fun. Skateparks are located around the world, and are specifically made for skateboarding. The architecture of skateparks is influenced from the origins of skateboarding and the type of skateboarding that has become popular. Some skateparks consist of heavy transition while others may mainly focus upon street style skateboarding.</p>
    
    <h3>Full Pipes</h3>
    <p>A Full Pipe is a roughly cylindrical and vertical geological passage. In the 1970’s , skateboarders from Riverside County, California, began using 7.3-metre-diameter (24 ft) water pipes in the central Arizona desert associated with the Central Arizona Project, a federal public works project to divert water from the Colorado River to the city of Phoenix. One popular and well known full pipe was “Baldy Pipeline”. Pipeline Skatepark was the first skatepark to incorporate a full pipe. Full Pipe skateboarding originated in the early 70’s, some skateparks incorporated full pipes to their design, and some skateboarders still seek out full pipes today just like during the orgins.
